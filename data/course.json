The lectures cover attacks that compromise security as well as techniques for achieving security, based on recent research papers. Topics include operating system security, privilege separation, capabilities, language-based security, cryptographic network protocols, trusted hardware, and security in web applications and mobile phones. The labs involve implementing and compromising a web application that sandboxes arbitrary code, supporting TLS certificates, and adding two-factor authentication.\n\nThe course materials, which can be accessed via the external link to the left, are available for reuse under a Creative Commons [Attribution 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) license.",
